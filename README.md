### Project Structure

- frontend (React Native, TypeScript)
- backend (fastAPI, Python)

Frontend is the React Native (Expo) client, and backend is Python using fastAPI.

Each directory has its own readme you can read for instructions and intro.

### How to commit

Your commit messages should start with the type of the task you worked on.
For example

`chore(back): Added chat bot endpoint`

Here, **chore** indicates the type of work done. In the parenthesis, we include front/back depending on what we worked on. Then, you end it with a colon and your commit message.

### Always start a branch

Always remember to start your own branch, we will have an automated system for branch creation through the task management system (Jira or Trello).
